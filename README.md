smallpt: Global Illumination in C#
(http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/)

This is a refactoring of Kevin Beason's smallpt in C#. Please visit Kevin's site for more information.

My purpose is to refactor smallpt for my own amusement and education...  This is similar to what Ronald Chen did in Java (http://pyrolistical.github.com/smallpt/).

I used my ported C# version (http://github.com/randyridge/smallpt-csharp) as a starting point.
